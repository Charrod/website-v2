# website-v2

## Basic info

The site is launching on 28th of February.

For now its just plain HTML, CSS and JS, since we're on such a tight schedule. After February we will put it on a proper platform.

## Work assignments

These will probably change, and we will work together on some.

* Front page: Keksike
* Hyperloop page: gordon13
* Team page: gordon13
* News page: ImAPyromaniac
* Shop page: KachanAleksey 


If you have questions ask them on Slack #webdev. Apparently me (Keksike) is running the development at this moment, so you can PM me too.
