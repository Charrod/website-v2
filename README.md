# website-v2

## Basic info

The site is launching on 28th of February.

For now its just plain HTML, CSS and JS. We didn't know who was familiar with what, so we decided to go simple for now since we're on such a tight schedule. After February when we have time for meetings and to talk things through we will put it on a proper platform.

## Work assignments

These will probably change, and we will work together on some.
